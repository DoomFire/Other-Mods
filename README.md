Other Various smaller Starbound mods to mess around with.

[]  Power Socket
    	- classy glitch descriptions/puns
    	- gunpoint style wire item: stuns/kills/damages whatever walks in front of it when activated trough wire (posibly makes what it is conected too also electrify)


[]  Shortcut Gates
	- Doorway attached to the background.
	- Entering the doorway will send the player to another doorway
		- Randomly generated ones could send to a randomly generated area, making it seem like you've entered an entire new area.
		- Player placed ones could instead be a sort of shortcut to another area.
  

[]  Jump Pads
    	- Jumppads will throw the player from the launchpad to a gravity cancelling landing pad.
	- They will calculate the force needed to launch the player via the Distance and the Angle
`		- Angle ( Will choose the lowest angle without collision to land ontop of the landing pad )
		- Distance ( Can find the landing pad via world.objectQuery. Then calculate the distance between them without collision. )
		- Force ( The amount of force required to throw the player exactly onto the landing pad. )
		- Angle x Distance = Force ( I think that's right anyway. )

[] (More) Realistic Mech Tech.
	- Changing the way mechs are spawned.
		- Instead of mech appearing around the player when 'special' is pressed, pressing 'special' begins a "Mech Drop" countdown.
		  When the countdown reaches 0, A particle spawns in the sky near the player, spawning a deactivated mech object.
		  Interacting with the object places the player inside it and destroys the object before activating the actual tech.
